            <h4> The goal of the CCRA is to purchase, assemble and continuely operate a full size (63’ by 28’) playing field for area teams to practice for competition. The long term plan is for the field to be centrally located at Tunxis Community College in Farmington. Our vision is for the field to become a resource for local FIRST teams. In addition, our partnership with Tunxis would be a model for future affiliations between FIRST teams and community colleges.</h4>

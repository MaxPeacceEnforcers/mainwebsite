    subtext: "The Central Connecticut Robotics Alliance (CCRA) is a group of professionals working with robotics teams. Our goal is to cultivate a collaborative environment for students and mentors through the creation of the first Community Robotics Center in Connecticut. The center will house full size robotics fields as well as work spaces for many robotics organizations. The organization will host competitive events and educational programs throughout the year.  We are passionate about making connections between industry & educational professionals and STEM students. Supporting future workforce development through local educational pathways."
